Workflow
========

To import some foreclosure data into a database, we want to perform the following steps, in order:

1. Save the data dictionary/ layout file as a CSV and edit as necessary (make sure header is in top row).
2. **If necessary,** clean the RealtyTrac data dictionary (`clean_data_dict.py`).
3. Create the database to hold our foreclosure records.
4. Convert the fixed-width files to comma-separated variable (CSV) files to be read.
5. Copy data to the table.

Steps 1 through 3 probably only need to be done for the Assessor and Foreclosure records as the Recorder data dictionary ("layout" file) is separate and in good condition.

Clean the RealtyTrac Data Dictionary
------------------------------------

```sh
$ python clean_data_dict.py dirty_dict.csv clean_dict.csv
```

Create the Database and Schema
------------------------------

Create a database `realtytrac` owned by `arthur`:

```sh
$ . create_db.sh realtytrac arthur
```

Then, create the `record` (Recorder) table, where `sr_unique_id` is the primary key.

```sh
$ python create_from_data_dict.py "record" data_dict.csv "sr_unique_id" | sudo -u postgres psql -d $DBNAME -f -
```

Convert Fixed-Width Files to CSV
--------------------------------

Where the field length column is at index 4:

```sh
$ . convert_fixed_width_to_csv.sh data_dict.csv 4 fixed_width_data.txt
```

Copy Data to Database Table
---------------------------

For example, copying data to the `record` (Recorder) table:

```sh
DBNAME=realtytrac
sudo -u postgres psql -d $DBNAME -c "COPY record FROM 'test.csv' WITH DELIMITER '>' NULL AS ''"
```
