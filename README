# Tutorial

To import some foreclosure data into a database, we want to perform the following steps, in order:

1. Clean the RealtyTrac data dictionary (`clean_data_dict.py`).
1. Subset the cleaned data dictionary to just those fields in foreclosure records (`subset_data_dict.py`).
1. Create the database to hold our foreclosure records.

## Clean the RealtyTrac Data Dictionary

```sh
$ python clean_data_dict.py dirty_dict.csv clean_dict.csv
```

## Subset the Cleaned Dictionary

For example, if we want only "Foreclosure" record fields:

```sh
$ python subset_data_dict.py clean_dict.csv "Foreclosure" output_dict.csv
```
